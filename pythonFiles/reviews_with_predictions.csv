Worth for money","Thickness may be slightly reduced and it might give good in-hand feel. Performance and Charging speed is good in this price range. Good Phone with average sound quality, 4G Connectivity only, but it works good. Best Battery life.",4.0,True,real

A Solid Choice for Everyday Use","I've been using this Samsung phone for a bit, and here's the lowdown. Considering it costs around ₹6,500-₹7,000, I think it's a pretty great deal.Sure, there are some compromises. No fingerprint sensor (the face unlock compensates some what for that), and yeah, not having a charger in the box is a bit of a hassle if you don't already have one. The speakers could be better, and a Full HD display would've been nice.But let's be real, at this price point, you can't expect perfection. If you're like me and just need a reliable phone for everyday stuff – calls, texts, social media, and some streaming – this phone gets the job done.Gaming enthusiasts might want to look elsewhere, but for casual users, I think this Samsung device is a solid choice.Would I recommend? Absolutely, for basic usage.",4.0,True,real

Its decent for its price","Processor- Slow processor but i guess you cant ask for much in this price bracket, the UI is smooth most of the time and its good enough to use social media apps and to watch videos and allCamera- Not very good but well we cant ask for much in this price range.Screen- Its actually really good for normal day to day usage, the colours and the sharpness is very decent,  i dont like the inclusion of thick bezels but i guess again its the price segment so cant ask for much, viewing angles are kinda badBattery- will last you a whole day if you try, it couldve been better thoBuild- Its solid, yes it makes the phone heavy and bulky but yeah its solid and has a good in hand feeling",3.0,True,real

Phone is well priced but the seller needs to wake up from their sleep","Seller Rating - STPL Exclusive Online (1 out of 5). Reason being they took 5 days to ship when it was mentioned ""one day delivery"" on the product page.Product Rating - (4.5 out of 5)For it's price (6,499/-), the phone is decent with almost everything you can hope for in this price range. At least far better than what JIO thinks a 4G phone should be (which is an absolute joke on it's own).Delivery rating - (5 out of 5) Being a regular customer I personally know the delivery person who's delivering all these years. He handles product very carefully and this time was no different. Kudos to him.",4.0,True,real
